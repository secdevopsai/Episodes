Becoming A Cybersecurity Alchemist 
===================================

What is Alchemy?
==============================

- A seemingly magical process of transformation, creation, or combination

How Alchemy Relates To Cybersecurity
======================================

- As security enthusiests and practicioner we are expected to facilitate the creation of security logs, then to transform the logs into actionable events to investigate, and that consists of combining together data sources and logs from many devices and products.  We aim to purify , mature, and nearly perfect security incidents.

What is required to become a Cybersecurity Alchemist?
============================================================
- **Data**
- **Programming**
- **Community**

Alchemy To Create Data
==============================

There's always a way to acquire some type of data whether it's data about individuals in our organization that we are attempting to protect or data that we're telling products to send data to.  As we become alchemists there are some very important questions to ask...

- Understand the business
- - Use the understanding to get your data
- - 1. Routing/Firewall/Network Security Logs
- - 2. Server Logs
- - 3. Endpoint Logs
- - 4. Reported Emails
- - 5. Reports / Threat Intelligence
- Explore and Clean Data
- Enrich Dataset
- Build Visualizations 
- Make Predictions On The Data
- Iterate (Do it again)

Alchemy To Transform Data
==============================
Programming is essential when working with large amounts of data.  Whether we decide to build something internally or if we employ a product - there was programming involved to make the transformation of big data possible.  Many modern security tools and products in general are becoming very extensible by providing REST APIs and sometimes an interface to create code in products.  Being one that can create code does not mean you know all aspects of a programming language or you have most of the language committed to memory.  A true programmer, developer, engineer and alchemist leverage many resources to create a new product.  For instance, documentation, stackoverflow, and other public resources are great things to leverage when writing code. There's an age old question about which Programming Languages to learn and how to get started.  I'm going to take a stab at it and mention a few programming languages that I think will take your cybersecurity practice to another level
- **Python**
- **Golang**

Python is hands down the programming language of choice for cybersecurity practicioners and for most of the world.  This programming language makes you instantly more valuable and will give you the career capital and confidence to expand your career in cybersecurity and other fields if you choose so. Python is an interpreted langauge, meaning the python code is read one line at a time from top to bottom - and there is no need for a compiler to execute your scripts.  This gives a programmer agility to create things on the fly and share scripts rather than compiled executables.  One thing we do sacrifice with Python is speed but in many cases that is ok because our devices are getting faster each year and so is our code execution timing

Another language that a cybersecurity practicioner should look into is Golang.  Go programming language is a programming language developed by Google to take advantage of concurrency and readability.  Reading and writing in this language is very easy especially if you're switching from Python.  Sometimes we create applications that are required to do many things at once.  An example here is a port scanner.  For a port scanner to be fast it must reach out to many ports and IP addresses at a single time and wait for a response (if there is one).  This is accomplished by concurrency and leveraging the multiple threads and cores in a CPU.  This number is ever-increasing and using the go programming langauge will give you the power to grow with technology with no additional code.

Alchemy That The Community Creates With YOU
==============================================

Leveraging and giving back to your community is essential in all aspects of life.  Just by watching this video or others you are leveraging your community just as I do when building this content.  My success is dependent on your success and feedback.  Sometimes it may be difficult to get insight into what your community is working on and generating ideas to give back.  I'd like to share a few that I find most helpful:
