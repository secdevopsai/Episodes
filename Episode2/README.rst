Episode 2 - Layer 8 Level Up Career, Life, and Self
========================================================

What Is Layer 8?
==================

Layer 8 is derived from the OSI Model.  Which is broken out in 7 layers:

1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Transport
7. Application

The OSI Model describes and standardizes communication functions for telecommunication networks [1]_ -- Think "Connected" devices (Including IoT!)

Layer 8 is a term used to refer to the **user**.  In fact, the OSI model can be abstracted out to additional layers too:

- Layer 8: The individual person.
- Layer 9: The organization.
- Layer 10: Government or legal compliance [2]_

Often times, Layer 8 is scrutinized and is associated with inefficiencies and vulnerabilities. Over the past decade there has been significant improvements in layer 1 - 7 applications and protocols. Layer 8 - The User, also has protocols that must be kept up to date and frequently patched. Example of Layer 8 Protocols:

- Productivity
- Creativity
- Efficiency
- Strategy
- Fitness
- Mindfulness
- Gratitude

Patching Layer 8
======================================

**Priming Yourself To Win**

- Start Your Morning At an Optimal Hour
- Create a Productive Space to Wake Up To
- Generate Ideas With a Journal
- Staying Hydrated
- Healthy Eating
- Meditation

**Understand Learning Style**

Am I a reader or a listener? The first thing to know is whether you are a reader or a listener. Far too
few people even know that there are readers and listeners and that people are rarely both. Even
fewer know which of the two they themselves are. But some examples will show how damaging
such ignorance can be. [3]_

**Accountability Partners**

Find individuals and groups with common goals and interest to sync with regularly. There are many open communities that enable and facilitate conversation and collaboration. It's vital to push yourself and leverage your community to find gaps in expertise and personal growth. Communities in Cybersecurity

- SecDevOps Slack community
- LinkedIn
- Reddit
- Twitter
- Meetup.com
- Conferences
